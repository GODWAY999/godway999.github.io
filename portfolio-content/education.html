        <p>Hunan University traces its history back to the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 AD during the Song dynasty.
            Shuyuan was one form of private educational institution in China;
            another form was government-sponsored academies including imperial central school Taixue or Guozijian and regional schools.
            The Yuelu Academy was a venue for Chinese scholars and their students to meet and discuss sophisticated topics in Confucian Studies.</p>
